# Heart-Disease-
This project aims to analyze, predict, and visualize heart disease risks using machine learning. The workflow involves data preprocessing, feature selection, dimensionality reduction (PCA), model training, evaluation, and deployment. Classification models will be used, alongside K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering for unsupervised learning.
